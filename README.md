# CO2 Emissions Regression Models

This project explores the relationship between certain features of cars and their CO2 emissions. We use scikit-learn to implement a simple and multiple linear, and polynomial regression models that will allow us to make future predictions of C02 emissions based on a car's metrics. More specifically, we will first focus on engine size and split data into training and testing sets, create a model, evaluate the model, and finally make predictions on unknown values. Then, we will use multiple factors by looking at how engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption impact emissions together. Finally, we will use polynomial regression to attempt to better fit the data.
