# CO2 Emissions Linear Regression Model

This project explores the relationship between certain features of cars and their CO2 emissions. We use scikit-learn to implement a simple and multiple linear regression model that will allow us to make future predictions of C02 emissions based on a car's metrics. More specifically, we will first focus on engine size and split data into training and testing sets, create a model, evaluate the model, and finally make predictions on unknown values. Then, we will use multiple factors by looking at how engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption impact emissions together.
