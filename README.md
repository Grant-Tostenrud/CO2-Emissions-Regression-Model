# CO2 Emissions Simple Linear Regression Model

This project explores the relationship between fuel consumption data and CO2 emissions of cars. We use scikit-learn to implement a simple linear regression model that will allow us to make future predictions of C02 emissions based on a car's fuel consumption metrics. More specifically, we will focus on engine size and split data into training and testing sets, create a model, evaluate the model, and finally make predictions on unknown values.
